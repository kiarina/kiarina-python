## Creating Knowledge

Determine where to save based on the type of knowledge.

- `docs/knowledges/`
  - Knowledge related to project operations and development
- `docs/playbooks/`
  - Playbooks that show decision-making and action procedures
- `docs/runbooks/`
  - Runbooks that show specific procedures for particular tasks

Once you have determined where to save, save it as a markdown file as shown below.

`docs/knowledges/about_xxx.md`
```markdown
