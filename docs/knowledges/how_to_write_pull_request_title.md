title: How to Write Pull Request Titles
description: Titles should follow Conventional Commits format
---

Pull Request titles should be written in English using the `type(scope): subject` format.
If the change is specific to a particular package, include the package name in the scope.
If the change spans multiple packages, separate multiple package names with commas.
If the content affects the entire project, the scope can be omitted.
