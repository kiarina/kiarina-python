## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Changed MIME type detection strategy to prioritize file extensions over content analysis
  - `detect_mime_type()` now prioritizes extension-based detection (custom dictionary â†’ mimetypes) before falling back to content analysis (puremagic)
  - **Philosophy**: File extensions represent explicit user intent and should be trusted
  - **Rationale**: More intuitive behavior for applications - `.md` files are treated as Markdown even if content looks like plain text
  - **Migration**: If your code relies on content-based detection taking precedence, you may need to adjust expectations
  - Reordered function arguments: `file_name_hint` is now the first parameter (before `raw_data` and `stream`)
  - Updated all docstrings and module documentation to reflect the new detection strategy
- Improved `detect_mime_type()` API to reduce cognitive load
  - Introduced `MimeDetectionOptions` TypedDict to group optional parameters
  - Replaced multiple individual parameters with a single `options` parameter
  - All detection options (mime_aliases, custom_mime_types, multi_extensions, etc.) are now passed through the `options` dictionary
  - Maintains backward compatibility through optional parameter design
  - Added comprehensive docstring examples for the new API

### Fixed
- Fixed symbolic link handling in `read_binary()` and `write_binary()` operations
  - Symlinks are now properly resolved to their target files using `os.path.realpath()`
  - Write operations through symlinks no longer replace the symlink with a regular file
  - File locks are now correctly applied to the actual target file, not the symlink itself
  - Added comprehensive tests for symlink operations including broken symlinks

### Fixed
- Fixed file permission preservation issue in `write_binary()` operations
  - Existing file permissions (mode, uid, gid) are now properly preserved when updating files
  - Added `_preserve_permissions()` function to maintain original file access controls
  - Implemented permission preservation for both sync and async write operations
  - Added comprehensive tests for permission preservation functionality
  - Improved security by preventing unintended permission changes during file updates
